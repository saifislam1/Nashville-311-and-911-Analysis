# Nashville-311-and-911-Analysis
My project will focus on the dataset provided by metro Nashville about service requests to hubnashville which is a comprehensive customer service system for residents and visitors and 911/615-862-8600 calls. An exploratory data analysis will be conducted to identify priority areas, trends, efficiency in handling customer complaints/requests etc.
